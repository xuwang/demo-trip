This is the a simple grails demo.

It is a grails exercise based on https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-grails05208 

To see the airports you created marked on the google map, goto http://localhost:8080/demo-trip/airport/map

If google map complains about the api key, you may need to get one from https://code.google.com/apis/console
and set 
	google.map.api.key = <your-api-key> in in the conf/Config.groovy
	
Enjoy!
